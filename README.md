## What's the dealio?

This template is based on a charcuterie dealership but if for some reason, that's not your business, you can customize the products and headers. This template sets up the process to:

- Grab products from Shopify for the main products page
- Use [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) to manage the state of the cart & products list
- Loop through the products in a details page that uses the product title as the route
- Add radio buttons for products with multiple variants
- Utilize the Shopify cart to add and remove items and
- Add taxes and shipping to show the user the total amount

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.3.
